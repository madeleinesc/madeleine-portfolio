                    <p>For most of my twenties I have known what I have wanted to do with my life; travel! I spent a decade travelling all over the world from England and France to Canada and China. In 2018 after living in Melbourne for a couple of years, I made the big decision to move to the USA then back to England, to live out this goal of mine! Unfortunately, like most, I ended up in a months long strict lockdown, all alone in central Manchester. Making the most of my situation, I decided to teach myself basic Python coding and inadvertently found my passion! Upon moving back to Australia, I enrolled in a web development and coding bootcamp and made this portfolio to show my work. Outside of work, I am an avid reader, a pop culture nerd and love to collect records. If you have any enquiries, please feel free to contact me!</p>

                    <p>In this project I was assigned to go over completed HTML/CSS code for a webpage. I was tasked with adding semantic elements, making sure the CSS structure was correct as well as giving the webpage a title that was a more concise description of what was included.</p>
