# MY PORTFOLIO

## Description
A portfolio is a greay way to highlight my work and projects to potential employers looking to fill new positions. 

For this task, I was assigned with creating my very own portfolio that I can then build on in the future.

## User Story
AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position

## Criteria
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport

## My Portfolio
My portfolio contains header, hero, about, work, contact and footer sections.
When my portfolio loads, you are greeted with a welcoming message of who I am and a simplistic header with navigation links to the rest of the page.
My About me section contains a recent photo of me and a brief description of who I am and what my site is about.
My work section contains 4 images in 2 rows/2 columns with varying sizes. The first image is larger than the other three and is a link to my very first project. The other 3 images contain links for future projects.
My contact section is a submit form for enquiries and my footer contains icons with links for my github and linkedIn profiles.
My portfolio is responsive:


This layout is for a desktop:

This layout is for mobile devices:

## Final Comments:
Through this task I learned how important it is to make a responsive layout and to make the page nice, simple and user friendly.

* I unfortunately could not get text over my images for my work section, but I shall be updating this.
